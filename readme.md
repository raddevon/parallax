####A minimal WordPress personal blogging theme

I'm in the very early stages of developing a new WordPress theme for my personal site at [raddevon.com](http://raddevon.com/). Rather than starting from scratch, this theme is based on the [Bones theme](http://themble.com/bones/).

The goal is to make a minimal theme with great typography and white space along with a bold but simple color scheme. I hope to ultimately add a portfolio page and a project post type that will populate that page.
